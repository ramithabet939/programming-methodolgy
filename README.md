## 📘 Course Overview

**Programming Methodology (COEN 244)** introduces the principles of **object-oriented programming (OOP)** using **C++**, focusing on problem-solving, code design, and reusability.  
The course emphasizes strong coding standards, modular design, and structured documentation through multiple programming assignments and lab projects.

### 🔹 Core Learning Objectives
- Understand and apply **object-oriented principles**: encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.  
- Implement modular and maintainable code using **C++ classes, constructors, and destructors**.  
- Master **operator overloading**, **file I/O**, and **templates** for reusable designs.  
- Utilize **abstract classes** and **virtual functions** for extensible architectures.  
- Develop testing and validation techniques for software reliability.

## 🧪 Compilation & Execution Guide

Most C++ assignments in this course can be compiled using the following commands:

### Compile all `.cpp` files
```bash
g++ *.cpp -o main
Run the program
bash
Copy code
./main
💡 For Windows users: Replace ./main with main.exe.

🧠 Key Topics Covered
Topic	Description
C++ Basics	Data types, functions, control structures
OOP Fundamentals	Classes, objects, constructors, destructors
Inheritance	Base and derived class hierarchies
Polymorphism	Virtual functions and dynamic binding
Operator Overloading	Custom operators for user-defined types
Templates	Generic programming for flexibility
File I/O	Reading and writing data streams
Exception Handling	Managing errors using try, catch, and throw
Design Principles	Code reuse, abstraction, and modularity

📄 Coding Standards
To maintain clarity and consistency, all programs follow these guidelines:

Proper header documentation including file purpose and author info.

Consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes).

Clear indentation and comments to describe logic.

Separate header (.h) and implementation (.cpp) files.

Each program tested with driver code and meaningful console output.
